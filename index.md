## About the game
========================================================

Bulls and Cows (also known as Pikes and Fixed) is a fun game that helps to increase your level of logic, concentration and analysis. The game is to guess a 4 digits secret number, which is randomly generated by the program and remains hidden. 

The aplication provides aids named Bulls and Cows for guessing the secret number.

- You get one Bull if you guess one digit and its position within the secret number.
- You get one Cow if you guess one digit but its position no matches within the secret number.

You win when you obtain 4 Bulls by guessing the number.

## Example
========================================================

The program creates the secret number 9785, the player inputs the number 7381.

- The number 8 is one Fixed because it is in the correct position.
- The number 7 is one Pike because it is within the secret number but its position no matches within the secret number.

In the next slide, show you the logical programming for count the pikes and fixed

## Logical programming
========================================================


```r
SecretNumber=c(9,7,8,5);InputNumber=c(7,3,8,1)
s=SecretNumber;i=InputNumber

# Counting the amount of fixed
Fixed=table(s==i)["TRUE"]
print(paste0("Fixed: ",Fixed))
```

```
## [1] "Fixed: 1"
```

```r
# Counting the amount of pikes
Pikes= length(c(s,i)[duplicated(c(s,i))])-Fixed
print(paste0("Pikes: ",Pikes))
```

```
## [1] "Pikes: 1"
```

## A little history 
========================================================

A computer program moo, written in 1970 by J. M. Grochow at MIT in the PL/I computer language for the Multics operating system, was amongst the first Bulls and Cows computer implementations, inspired by a similar program written by Frank King in 1968 and running on the Cambridge University mainframe. Because the game has simple rules, while it is difficult and entertaining, there are many computer variants; it is often included in telephones and PDAs.

It is proven that any number could be solved within seven turns
